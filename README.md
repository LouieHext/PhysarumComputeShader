# Physarum Compute Shader

This uses openframeworks and computer shaders.
Computer Shaders require openGL 4.3 and so this is will not run on MacOS
It features a GUI in which you can control the simulation params

To run, 
create a new openframeWorks Project with the ofxGui add on.
Clone this repo
copy in the code from this into the project you just created,
run.
